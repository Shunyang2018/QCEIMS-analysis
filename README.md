## jobarray tool:

I wrote this small tool to run array through slurm system.
It is flexible with CPUs and can help you avoid queuing!
To use this tool:

1)copy the array.bash and bin file and the tmol file to your folder. 
2)You need to change the settings in array.bash code, 
	including the 
	$workdir and $user
3)run 'bash array.bash [STUCTURE].tmolâ€™

4)after the jobs finished, you can find all the files including result.jdx 
Under $workdir/[STUCTURE] folder.
