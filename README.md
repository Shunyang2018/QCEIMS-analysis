# QCEIMS-analysis
1. deal with different kinds of file related to QCEIMS and NIST 17, for example, sdf, msp, jdx,mol;

2. ways to calculate scores including Cos, Dot and Match similarity, according to:

   https://doi.org/10.1016/1044-0305(94)85022-4, Stein 1994
3. plot functions (MSpec.py)

4. qceims.out analysis is done by qceimsout.py, which has two modes: -f and -b 

5. some useful tools in experimental spectra search:

## jobarray tool:

I wrote this small tool to run array through slurm system.
It is flexible with CPUs and can help you avoid queuing!
To use this tool:

1)copy the array.bash and bin file and the tmol file to your folder. 

2)You need to change the settings in array.bash code, 
	including the 
	$workdir and $user
	
3)run 'bash array.bash [STUCTURE].tmolâ€™

4)after the jobs finished, you can find all the files including result.jdx 
Under $workdir/[STUCTURE] folder.

## plotms-v8
Using hash table to record the accurate mass value and calculate the mass spectrum.
The [Isotopic Masses and Natural Abundances](https://www.chem.ualberta.ca/~massspec/atomic_mass_abund.pdf)
#### To compile it:
`ifort -c dictionary_m.f90`
`ifort -c plotms-v8.f90`
`ifort plotms-v8.o dictionary_m.o -o plotmsv8`
#### Attention:
The peaks are not normlized.
#### To use it:
Put the `qceims.res` file and `plotmsv8` program at the same folder, run the program. 
You will get integer MS in `result.jdx` and accurate MS in `accuratemass.jdx`
